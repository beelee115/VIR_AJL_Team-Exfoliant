## ⚙️ Setup & Execution

## 📌 Project Overview
**🏆 The Competition & Break Through Tech AI**

This project is part of the Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellowship, where we are competing in the Equitable AI for Dermatology Build Competition on Kaggle. Hosted in collaboration with the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL), the challenge brings together AI fellows to develop machine learning solutions that promote fairness and inclusivity in dermatological AI.

**🎯 Objective of the Challenge**

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies 21 different skin conditions across diverse skin tones. Traditional dermatology AI tools often struggle with misdiagnosis for people with darker skin due to biased datasets. By improving model performance for underrepresented groups, we aim to create a more equitable and inclusive AI system.

**🌱 Real-World Impact**

Misdiagnosis in dermatology can lead to delayed treatments, poor health outcomes, and systemic disparities in healthcare. By ensuring our model works well across all skin tones, we contribute to advancing AI fairness and reducing bias in medical AI tools. Our work aligns with AJL’s mission to illuminate AI harms and promote ethical, responsible AI development.

## 📊 Data Exploration

**🗂 Dataset Overview**

Our dataset consists of dermatological images categorized into 21 different skin conditions, with metadata such as Fitzpatrick skin type, Dermatological Diversity Index scale (ddi_scale), and Quality Control scores (qc scores). 

**🔍 Key Insights & Challenges**

Class Imbalance: Some skin conditions are significantly underrepresented, which may impact model performance.

Outliers in ddi_scale: Potential anomalies in the dataset require careful handling.

Missing & Duplicate Data: Preprocessing includes checking for and addressing any inconsistencies.

**📊 Visualizations & Analysis**

Class Distribution: Understanding the prevalence of each skin condition in the dataset.
