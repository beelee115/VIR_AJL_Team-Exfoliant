# VIR_AJL_Team-Exfoliant

## Project Overview, Objectives, and Goals

Welcome to the **VIR_AJL_Team_Exfoliant** Project! This project is part of the **Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellowship**, where we are building a model as part of the Equitable AI for Dermatology Build Competition. Our goal is to build an ML model that classifies skin conditions across diverse skin tones, since people with darker skin tones often get misdiagnosed. As such, with this model we hope to advance equity by centering those historically excluded in AI.
